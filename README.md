# MRE

Adding tabs makes it so the version selector no longer switches the URL when a different version is selected. I think thatâ€™s a bug.

This is a simple MRE that demonstrates the issue I'm having with the version selector.

Using the mint.json in this repo, the switching works.

Using the contents in mint-tabs.json in this repo, the switching does not work.

Updated NPM packages to double check that wasn't the issue.
